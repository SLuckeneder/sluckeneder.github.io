I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.wu.ac.at/en/ecolecon/institute" target="_blank">Institute for Ecological Economics</a> at Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU), where I am an active member of the <a href="https://resource-use.global/" target="_blank">Global Resource Use</a> research group. My work centres on ecological and development economics, with a particular focus on the interplay between natural resources and socioeconomic systems. To address these complexities, I primarily apply econometric and statistical methods.

I completed my PhD in ecological economics at WU under the supervision of Dr. Stefan Giljum, where my dissertation examined the direct and indirect environmental and socioeconomic impacts of mining activities. By leveraging granular geospatial data, I worked on several key areas: (i) assessing the contextual risks of expanding mining operations into vulnerable ecosystems, (ii) examining the effects of mining on regional economic development and forest cover loss at the example of mining in Brazil, and (iii) tracing the local environmental impacts of mining activities along global supply chains from production to consumption.
